# Kate Syntax Highlighting
Syntax highlighting files I've made for [Kate](https://kate-editor.org).

See [Working with Syntax Highlighting](https://docs.kde.org/stable5/en/kate/katepart/highlight.html) for information on adding custom highlighting files to Kate.

Please let me know if you encounter any errors in the syntax highlighting. I'll try to fix them as soon as possible.

## Highlighting Files
### mcfunction
[Minecraft function files](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Function_(Java_Edition)), used in [data packs](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Data_pack). This syntax highlighting file is designed to make function files easier to read, and catch syntax errors before they happen. Not all commands have proper highlighting yet.

### hjson
See [Hjson, a user interface for JSON](https://hjson.github.io).
